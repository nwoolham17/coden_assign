            <p>Early history (1877–1929)
                The club was founded by the Reverend Joseph Farrall Wright, Perpetual curate of Christ Church Bolton, and Thomas Ogden, the schoolmaster at the adjacent church school, in 1874 as Christ Church F.C.
                <br>
                It was initially run from the church of the same name on Deane Road, Bolton, on the site where the Innovation factory of the University of Bolton now stands.
                <br> 
                The club left the location following a dispute with the vicar, and changed its name to Bolton Wanderers in 1877. 
                <br>
                The name was chosen as the club initially had a lot of difficulty finding a permanent ground to play on, having used three venues in its first four years of existence.
                <br>
                Bolton were one of the 12 founder members of the Football League, which formed in 1888. 
                <br>
                At the time Lancashire was one of the strongest footballing regions in the country, with 6 of the 12 founder clubs coming from within the boundaries of the historic county of Lancashire. 
                <br>
                Having remained in the Football League since its formation, Bolton have spent more time in the top flight (Premier League/old First Division) than out of it.</p>
